How should I structure a C++ choose-your-own-adventure program that uses multiple rooms and functions?

What’s the best way to return the player to a main hub area from different rooms?

How do I store whether the player has an item, like a key, using a boolean variable?

Should the global variable for the key item be a bool or something else?

Can you help me write a reusable function that forces the player to choose a number between two values?

Where should I set the boolean to true once the player finds the pants?

Where should I change game_over = true so the program exits cleanly?

Why won’t my ending trigger? Should the ending functions set the game_over variable?

Why isn’t the game checking my boolean correctly? Did I place the condition in the wrong room?

Why does my program keep repeating the room? Am I missing a return statement?
